"""UI export presence tests for Feature 002.

Historically we had two separate tests asserting hasattr(...) on the module.
Those were a bit flaky during iterative edits. We now:
  * Mock streamlit early
  * Import the functions directly (will raise ImportError deterministically if missing)
  * Assert they are callables in a single consolidated test
This provides a fastâ€‘fail signal without brittle attribute checks.
